## Materials and Methods

### Study design

We developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental model of *Bordetella pertussis* transmission to evaluate how vaccine mechanism assumptions and macrolide resistance jointly affect infant disease burden, all-age infection burden, notified cases, resistant infections, and intervention prioritization. The model follows the mechanistic tradition of pertussis resurgence models, but extends the state space to include vaccine-origin histories, two strain classes, country-specific demographic and contact profiles, and resistance-dependent treatment and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) effects [1-8].

Eight national profiles were analyzed: Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Country-specific inputs were derived from United Nations World Population Prospects denominators, WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form and immunization schedule records, reported pertussis surveillance series through 2023, Prem/contactdata social-contact matrices, and a macrolide-resistance evidence timeline anchored to the latest admissible evidence year for each country [4-8,12,13]. The principal simulations used a 60-year pre-analysis burn-in to reduce dependence on arbitrary initial conditions, followed by a 30-year analysis horizon beginning on 1 January 2026, with model output retained at 7-day intervals.

All incidence measures are reported as annualized counts per 100,000 persons unless stated otherwise. Infant outcomes combine the 0-2 month and 3-11 month age groups, because these strata jointly capture the highest-risk pre-primary-series and partially vaccinated infant population.

### Country profile construction

Population denominators were aggregated from one-year age groups into five model strata. Age 0 population was partitioned as 25% aged 0-2 months and 75% aged 3-11 months; ages 1-6 years, 7-17 years, and 18 years or older were then aggregated directly. Let \(N_i\) denote the resulting population in age group \(i\).

Routine and maternal immunization inputs were transformed into age-specific vaccine-origin coverage proxies using DTP1 coverage \(v_1\), DTP3 coverage \(v_3\), maternal coverage \(m\), the number of childhood booster doses \(b\), and an indicator \(A\) for an adolescent booster programme:

$$
v_{0-2m}=\mathrm{clip}(0.02+0.55m,\ 0.02,\ 0.75),
$$

$$
v_{3-11m}=\mathrm{clip}(0.75v_1+0.12v_3+0.12m,\ 0,\ 0.95),
$$

$$
v_{1-6y}=\mathrm{clip}\{v_3[0.88+0.04\min(b,2)],\ 0,\ 0.98\},
$$

$$
v_{7-17y}=\mathrm{clip}\{v_3[0.58+0.10\min(b,2)+0.12A],\ 0,\ 0.95\},
$$

$$
v_{18+y}=\mathrm{clip}(0.12+0.10A+0.03m,\ 0.10,\ 0.75).
$$

These deterministic transformations assign individuals to mechanistic protection histories and do not imply that adult pertussis immunization coverage is directly observed in all settings.

Seasonal forcing parameters were inferred from the timing of positive reported cases. For observation \(l\), let \(c_l\) be reported cases and \(\theta_l=2\pi(d_l-1)/365\), where \(d_l\) is the day of year. The circular concentration was

$$
R_c=
\frac{
\left[(\sum_l c_l\sin\theta_l)^2+(\sum_l c_l\cos\theta_l)^2\right]^{1/2}
}{
\max(\sum_l c_l,10^{-9})
},
$$

with annual phase

$$
\phi =
\left[
\frac{365}{2\pi}\mathrm{atan2}\left(\sum_l c_l\sin\theta_l,\sum_l c_l\cos\theta_l\right)+1
\right]\bmod 365
$$

and annual amplitude

$$
a=\mathrm{clip}(0.08+0.55R_c,\ 0.08,\ 0.35).
$$

Multi-year recurrence was treated as a diagnostic forcing component. Annual reported-case peaks were identified with a minimum spacing of two years and a prominence threshold equal to 10% of the maximum annual count. A 3-5 year median peak interval was considered compatible with multi-year recurrence; otherwise the multi-year amplitude was set to zero.

Prem/contactdata matrices were first represented on 5-year age bins and then aggregated to the five model age groups using population weights. If \(P_{ab}\) is the fine-age contact matrix, \(w_{ia}\) is the distribution of age group \(i\) over fine source bin \(a\), and \(f_{jb}\) is the fraction of fine target bin \(b\) belonging to model group \(j\), then

$$
C_{ij}^{raw}=\sum_a\sum_b w_{ia}P_{ab}f_{jb}.
$$

Population-weighted reciprocity was imposed by replacing each off-diagonal pair with the shared contact total

$$
\tilde{C}_{ij}=
\frac{C_{ij}^{raw}N_i+C_{ji}^{raw}N_j}{2N_i},
\quad
\tilde{C}_{ji}=
\frac{C_{ij}^{raw}N_i+C_{ji}^{raw}N_j}{2N_j}.
$$

This correction preserves the average number of cross-group contacts while ensuring \(N_i\tilde{C}_{ij}=N_j\tilde{C}_{ji}\).

### Age groups, strains, and state variables

The model uses five age groups:

$$
i \in \mathcal{A} = \{0\text{-}2m,\ 3\text{-}11m,\ 1\text{-}6y,\ 7\text{-}17y,\ 18+y\}.
$$

Pertussis infections are divided into macrolide-sensitive and macrolide-resistant strains:

$$
k \in \mathcal{K} = \{S,R\}.
$$

Susceptible individuals retain vaccine or maternal-protection origin histories:

$$
o \in \mathcal{O} = \{U,\ M,\ D1_R,\ D1_W,\ D2_R,\ D2_W,\ D3_R,\ D3_W\}.
$$

Here \(U\) is unvaccinated, \(M\) is maternally protected, \(D1\) and \(D2\) are one- and two-dose histories, and \(D3\) represents three-or-more-dose histories; subscripts \(R\) and \(W\) denote recent and waned protection.

For each age group, the model tracks susceptible-origin states \(S_{i,o}\), exposed states \(E_{i,k,o}\), symptomatic infectious states \(I^{sym}_{i,k,o}\), asymptomatic infectious states \(I^{asym}_{i,k,o}\), treated infectious states \(T_{i,k,o}\), and naturally immune states \(R_i\). The per-age state space contains 8 susceptible-origin states, 16 exposed states, 32 infectious states, 16 treated states, and one naturally immune state, yielding 73 compartments per age group and 365 dynamic state variables.

### Vaccine mechanism parameterization

Four vaccine mechanism parameters define a scenario:

$$
\mathrm{VE}_{sus},\quad \mathrm{VE}_{sym},\quad \mathrm{VE}_{inf},\quad \mathrm{VE}_{dur}.
$$

These represent reductions in susceptibility to infection, symptomatic disease given infection, onward infectiousness, and infectious duration, respectively. Vaccine effects are origin-specific through a relative effect weight \(w_o \in [0,1]\). The default weights distinguish maternal protection, partial-dose histories, recent three-or-more-dose protection, and waned protection:

$$
w_o =
\begin{cases}
0, & o=U,\\
w_M, & o=M,\\
w_1, & o=D1_R,\\
w_1w_W, & o=D1_W,\\
w_2, & o=D2_R,\\
w_2w_W, & o=D2_W,\\
1, & o=D3_R,\\
w_W, & o=D3_W.
\end{cases}
$$

The origin-specific susceptibility multiplier is

$$
q_o = \max(0, 1 - w_o\mathrm{VE}_{sus}).
$$

The probability that an infection in age group \(i\) and origin \(o\) is symptomatic is

$$
\rho_{i,o} = \mathrm{clip}\{\rho_i(1-w_o\mathrm{VE}_{sym}),0,1\},
$$

where \(\rho_i\) is the age-specific baseline symptom probability. The origin-specific infectiousness multiplier is

$$
\eta_o = \mathrm{clip}(1-w_o\mathrm{VE}_{inf},0,1),
$$

and vaccine shortening of infectious duration is represented by a recovery-rate multiplier

$$
m_o = \left[\max(0.05,1-w_o\mathrm{VE}_{dur})\right]^{-1}.
$$

This formulation separates protection against infection, clinical disease, onward infectiousness, and duration of infectiousness. It therefore permits aP-like profiles with strong protection against symptoms but weak infection or transmission blocking, as well as hypothetical next-generation profiles with stronger effects on colonization and transmission [1-3,9,10].

### Seasonal transmission and force of infection

Let \(N_i(t)\) denote the current population in age group \(i\), and \(C_{ij}\) the country-specific reciprocity-balanced contact rate from age group \(i\) to age group \(j\). Seasonal forcing is country specific:

$$
s(t) = \max\left(0,\left[1+a\cos\left(\frac{2\pi(d(t)-\phi)}{365}\right)\right]\left[1+a_m\cos\left(\frac{2\pi(t-\phi_m)}{365P_m}\right)\right]\right),
$$

where \(a\) and \(\phi\) are annual amplitude and phase, \(d(t)\) is calendar day of year, and the optional multi-year term has amplitude \(a_m\), period \(P_m\), and phase \(\phi_m\). The multi-year component is included only when surveillance-derived peak diagnostics support recurrent 3-5 year structure.

The infectious pressure contributed by age group \(j\) and strain \(k\) is

$$
\Pi_{j,k}(t) =
\frac{1}{N_j(t)}
\sum_{o \in \mathcal{O}}
\eta_o\left[
I^{sym}_{j,k,o}
+ r_A I^{asym}_{j,k,o}
+ \zeta_k T_{j,k,o}
\right],
$$

where \(r_A\) is the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic infection. The treated-state infectiousness multiplier is strain-specific:

$$
\zeta_k = 1 - e^{inf}_k,
$$

where \(e^{inf}_k\) is the treatment-associated reduction in infectiousness for strain \(k\). The pre-PEP forces of infection are

$$
\lambda^0_{i,S}(t) = \beta_S s(t)\sum_j C_{ij}\Pi_{j,S}(t),
$$

$$
\lambda^0_{i,R}(t) = \beta_S f_R s(t)\sum_j C_{ij}\Pi_{j,R}(t),
$$

where \(\beta_S\) is the sensitive-strain transmission parameter and \(f_R\) is the resistant-strain relative fitness.

Postexposure prophylaxis is represented as a prevalence-triggered reduction in force of infection. Let

$$
D(t)=
\frac{\sum_i p_i^{det}(t)\sum_{k,o} I^{sym}_{i,k,o}}{\sum_i N_i(t)}
$$

be detected symptomatic prevalence, and

$$
A(t)=\frac{D(t)}{D(t)+h}
$$

the activation function, where \(h\) is the activation prevalence. With PEP coverage \(c_{PEP}\) and strain-specific PEP effectiveness \(e^{PEP}_k\),

$$
\lambda_{i,k}(t)=\lambda^0_{i,k}(t)\left[1-c_{PEP}A(t)e^{PEP}_k\right].
$$

PEP is therefore represented as a force-of-infection modifier rather than as a separate prophylaxis state. PEP-averted cases are calculated as a diagnostic contrast between pre-PEP and post-PEP infection flows, not as an additional compartment.

### Infection progression, treatment, and recovery

New infections from susceptible-origin state \(S_{i,o}\) enter the strain-specific exposed states:

$$
\frac{dE_{i,k,o}}{dt}\bigg|_{infection} = \lambda_{i,k}(t)q_oS_{i,o}.
$$

Let \(\sigma\) be the exposed-to-infectious progression rate, \(\gamma_{sym}\) and \(\gamma_{asym}\) baseline recovery rates, and \(\tau_{sym}\) and \(\tau_{asym}\) treatment rates. The infection progression equations are:

$$
\frac{dE_{i,k,o}}{dt} = \lambda_{i,k}q_oS_{i,o} - \sigma E_{i,k,o},
$$

$$
\frac{dI^{sym}_{i,k,o}}{dt} =
\rho_{i,o}\sigma E_{i,k,o}
- \tau_{sym}I^{sym}_{i,k,o}
- m_o\gamma_{sym}I^{sym}_{i,k,o},
$$

$$
\frac{dI^{asym}_{i,k,o}}{dt} =
(1-\rho_{i,o})\sigma E_{i,k,o}
- \tau_{asym}I^{asym}_{i,k,o}
- m_o\gamma_{asym}I^{asym}_{i,k,o}.
$$

Treated infections follow:

$$
\frac{dT_{i,k,o}}{dt} =
\tau_{sym}I^{sym}_{i,k,o}
+ \tau_{asym}I^{asym}_{i,k,o}
- m_o\gamma^T_kT_{i,k,o},
$$

with

$$
\gamma^T_k =
\frac{\gamma_{sym}}{\max(0.05,1-e^{dur}_k)},
$$

where \(e^{dur}_k\) is the treatment-associated reduction in infectious duration for strain \(k\). Macrolide-resistant infections therefore receive smaller treatment effects unless a resistance-guided strategy modifies the resistant treatment block.

Naturally immune states receive all recoveries and wane at rate \(\omega_N\):

$$
\frac{dR_i}{dt} =
\sum_{k,o}m_o\left[
\gamma_{sym}I^{sym}_{i,k,o}
+ \gamma_{asym}I^{asym}_{i,k,o}
+ \gamma^T_kT_{i,k,o}
\right]
-\omega_NR_i.
$$

### Waning vaccine and maternal protection

Maternal protection wanes into unvaccinated susceptibility at rate \(\omega_M\):

$$
\frac{dS_{i,\mathrm{maternal}}}{dt}\bigg|_{waning}=-\omega_MS_{i,\mathrm{maternal}},
\quad
\frac{dS_{i,\mathrm{unvaccinated}}}{dt}\bigg|_{maternal\ waning}=+\omega_MS_{i,\mathrm{maternal}}.
$$

Recent vaccine-dose states wane into corresponding waned states at rate \(\omega_V\), and waned vaccine states return to unvaccinated susceptibility at rate \(\omega_W\). For each dose category \(d\),

$$
\frac{dS_{i,d,recent}}{dt}\bigg|_{waning}=-\omega_VS_{i,d,recent},
$$

$$
\frac{dS_{i,d,waned}}{dt}\bigg|_{waning}=+\omega_VS_{i,d,recent}-\omega_WS_{i,d,waned},
$$

$$
\frac{dS_{i,\mathrm{unvaccinated}}}{dt}\bigg|_{waned\ loss}=+\omega_WS_{i,d,waned}.
$$

Routine vaccination is implemented as a relaxation toward country-specific age-group coverage targets. For age group \(i\), desired vaccine-origin mass is proportional to current population \(N_i(t)\), target coverage \(v_i\), and target origin distribution \(g_{i,o}\). For vaccine-dose origins, the deficit is

$$
\delta_{i,o}(t)=
\max\left[
0,\ 
\frac{v_iN_i(t)g_{i,o}}{\sum_{o'\in\mathcal{V}}g_{i,o'}}
-S_{i,o}(t)
\right],
$$

where \(\mathcal{V}\) is the set of vaccine-dose origins. The total vaccination flow from unvaccinated susceptibility is

$$
F_i(t)=\min\left[
\kappa_V\sum_{o\in\mathcal{V}}\delta_{i,o}(t),\ S_{i,U}(t)
\right],
$$

and is distributed in proportion to \(\delta_{i,o}(t)\). This formulation prevents vaccination flows from exceeding the available unvaccinated susceptible pool.

Before burn-in, country-specific vaccine coverage initializes susceptible-origin mass using age-specific origin distributions. The default allocation assigns maternal protection to 0-2 month infants, partial-dose histories to 3-11 month infants, and recent or waned three-or-more-dose histories to older age groups. Initial exposed and infectious seeds are allocated by age and by the susceptible-origin shares within each age group, with strains split according to the initial resistance prevalence.

### Resistance initialization and importation

Each resistance scenario specifies a target resistant fraction at the start of the analysis period. After burn-in, active exposed, infectious, and treated compartments are rebalanced so that for every origin and active compartment pair,

$$
X_{i,R,o}^{active} \leftarrow p_R X_{i,\cdot,o}^{active},
\quad
X_{i,S,o}^{active} \leftarrow (1-p_R)X_{i,\cdot,o}^{active},
$$

where \(p_R\) is the target resistant fraction. This separates the intended resistance scenario from strain fixation that can arise during long deterministic burn-in. Country-timeline scenarios use the latest admissible country-specific resistance estimate at or before the anchor year; fixed scenarios use the low, moderate, high, or very-high values specified in Table S3.

No ongoing prevalence anchoring was applied during the saved analysis period. After the burn-in rebalance, the resistant fraction evolves through differential strain fitness, treatment and PEP effects, susceptible-origin composition, and importation.

Low-level importation adds exposed infections at a country-level rate \(u\) per 100,000 persons per year. With age distribution \(a_i^{imp}\) and resistant importation fraction \(p_R^{imp}\),

$$
M_i(t)=\frac{u}{100000 \times 365}N_{\cdot}a_i^{imp},
$$

and imports are distributed across susceptible origins according to their current share of the susceptible-origin pool. The imported exposed flow is \(M_i(t)p_R^{imp}\) for resistant infection and \(M_i(t)(1-p_R^{imp})\) for sensitive infection. Imported infections are subtracted from susceptible-origin pools according to the current origin composition, preserving vaccine-origin accounting.

### Demography and age movement

Demographic turnover keeps country-specific age profiles approximately stationary while allowing cohort movement through the state space. Age-exit rates \(\mu_i\) are chosen so that the absolute ageing flow implied by the reference infant age group is compatible with the country-specific age profile. For a generic compartment \(X_i\),

$$
\frac{dX_i}{dt}\bigg|_{ageing} =
-\mu_iX_i + \mu_{i-1}X_{i-1}
$$

for non-youngest age groups. The oldest age group exits at rate \(\mu_A\). Total births equal the outflow from the oldest age group and enter the youngest group according to the country-specific birth-entry distribution. Maternal protection in the youngest infant group is treated as short-lived maternally derived protection and is converted back to unvaccinated susceptibility when infants age out of the 0-2 month group.

### Numerical solution and burn-in

The model is a continuous-time ordinary differential equation system with rates expressed per day. Main simulations were solved using an adaptive Runge-Kutta method with relative tolerance \(10^{-5}\) and absolute tolerance \(10^{-7}\). State values were projected to non-negative values when evaluating rates so that small numerical undershoots could not produce negative force-of-infection, recovery, or vaccination flows.

The main analysis used 60 years of burn-in followed by resistance rebalancing and a 30-year saved analysis period. Calibration simulations used a shortened burn-in and coarser output interval to reduce computational cost while preserving annual case totals for likelihood evaluation. All summary statistics were computed from the saved analysis interval only.

### Observation model and incidence summaries

Model output records instantaneous daily rates at scheduled output times and converts rates to interval counts by trapezoidal integration. For an interval \([t_{\ell-1},t_\ell]\) and rate \(r(t)\),

$$
\widehat{C}_\ell =
\frac{r(t_{\ell-1})+r(t_\ell)}{2}
(t_\ell-t_{\ell-1}).
$$

Age-specific symptomatic case incidence is

$$
C^{sym}_{i,k}(t)=\sum_o \lambda_{i,k}(t)q_oS_{i,o}(t)\rho_{i,o}.
$$

Reported cases are

$$
C^{rep}_{i,k}(t)=p_i^{rep}(t)C^{sym}_{i,k}(t),
$$

where \(p_i^{rep}(t)\) is the age-specific final reporting probability, optionally modified by reporting-rate sensitivity scenarios or calibration. Reporting probabilities are clipped to \([0,1]\) after applying any multiplier or time-varying sensitivity scenario.

Annualized incidence per 100,000 persons over an analysis period of length \(Y\) years is

$$
I_{all}=\frac{\sum_{t,i,k}C^{inf}_{i,k}(t)}{Y\bar{N}_{\cdot}}100000,
$$

$$
I_{reported}=\frac{\sum_{t,i,k}C^{rep}_{i,k}(t)}{Y\bar{N}_{\cdot}}100000,
$$

$$
I_{infant}=\frac{\sum_{t,i \in \mathcal{I},k}C^{sym}_{i,k}(t)}{Y\bar{N}_{\mathcal{I}}}100000,
$$

where \(\mathcal{I}\) includes the two infant age groups. Relative reduction for an outcome \(Z\) versus comparator \(Z_0\) is

$$
\Delta_Z = 1-\frac{Z}{Z_0}.
$$

### Calibration and likelihood

Country-level calibration targets annual reported cases. The observed series uses WHO reported-case extracts when available and otherwise uses the harmonized pertussis surveillance series; observations after the 2023 surveillance cutoff were excluded from incidence calibration. The calibration window retains the six most recent observed annual records, aligns model time to the first retained observed year, and allocates modelled reporting intervals across calendar-year boundaries before comparing annual totals.

The full calibration vector can adjust the sensitive-strain transmission coefficient \(\beta_S\), the reporting multiplier, seasonal amplitude, importation rate, and resistant importation fraction:

$$
\theta =
\{\log\beta_S,\ \log m_{rep},\ \mathrm{logit}(a/0.35),\ \log u,\ \mathrm{logit}(p_R^{imp})\}.
$$

The admissible ranges were \(\beta_S\in[0.002,0.2]\), \(m_{rep}\in[0.1,10]\), \(a\in[0,0.35]\), \(u\in[0.01,2]\) imported infections per 100,000 persons per year, and \(p_R^{imp}\in[0,1]\). The principal calibration used a staged search that brackets and bisects \(\beta_S\) against the mean observed annual reports, followed by a reporting-multiplier adjustment within prior bounds. A full L-BFGS-B formulation is retained for the same parameter vector as an alternative optimizer. The likelihood for annual reported cases is negative binomial:

$$
Y_t \sim \mathrm{NegBin}(\mu_t,r),
$$

with probability parameter

$$
p_t=\frac{r}{r+\mu_t}.
$$

The negative log-likelihood is

$$
-\ell =
-\sum_t
\left[
\log \Gamma(Y_t+r)
-\log \Gamma(r)
-\log \Gamma(Y_t+1)
+r\log p_t
+Y_t\log(1-p_t)
\right].
$$

Reporting-rate priors penalize calibrated reporting probabilities that fall outside country-specific literature-informed bounds. For lower and upper bounds \(L_i\) and \(U_i\), penalty weight \(\xi\), and calibrated probability \(p_i^{rep}\),

$$
P_{rep} =
\xi\sum_i
\begin{cases}
\left(\frac{L_i-p_i^{rep}}{U_i-L_i}\right)^2, & p_i^{rep}<L_i,\\
\left(\frac{p_i^{rep}-U_i}{U_i-L_i}\right)^2, & p_i^{rep}>U_i,\\
0, & L_i\le p_i^{rep}\le U_i.
\end{cases}
$$

The retained fit minimizes the negative log-likelihood plus \(P_{rep}\). Calibration results were considered accepted when the optimizer returned a finite solution and the modeled mean annual reported incidence was within the pre-specified relative tolerance of the observed mean over the calibration window.

### Scenario analyses and uncertainty evaluation

The scenario analysis had six components:

1. Vaccine mechanism scenarios contrasting no vaccine, symptom-protective aP-like protection, stronger infection blocking, stronger transmission blocking, and next-generation protection.
2. Macrolide-resistance scenarios with country-specific evidence anchors and fixed low, moderate, high, and very-high targets.
3. A grid varying \(\mathrm{VE}_{inf}\) and initial, target, and importation resistant prevalence together.
4. Intervention strategies modifying coverage, maternal protection, adolescent boosting, resistance-guided treatment, PEP effectiveness, and vaccine mechanism assumptions.
5. Reporting-rate sensitivity scenarios.
6. Global sensitivity analysis over vaccine effects, immunity waning, transmission, treatment, PEP, resistance fitness, and reporting.

Global sensitivity analysis used a Latin-hypercube design with 24 parameter sets. Parameter-outcome associations were summarized using Pearson correlations between sampled parameter values and total infant cases, providing a screening measure of direction and relative influence rather than a full variance-decomposition estimate.
